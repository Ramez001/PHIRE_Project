# Temple-2019-2020-PHIRE-lab-work-
During my senior year of high school, I worked at the Temple University PHIRE lab, where I built a robotic arm from scratch. I programmed the arm with sensors to perform basic tasks using C++ code. This project was published in the Temple University database in 2020.
